# FetchProject
Fetch Rewards Coding Assignment

# To run
1. npm install
2. npm start
3. Port: 3000

# Notes
The API has CORS disabled, so I couldn't do a fetch. I was going to set up a proxy to get around this but I assume that is not what you are looking for.

# Bonus features
- Search bar, search for item name or list id or both
- Responsive. Mobile design implemented.

Thank you!
